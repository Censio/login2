            Hi, friends from CMT
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Whatever who you are and what your title is if you're reading this it means the internal infrastructure of your company is currenty being recorded, encrypted and deleted by us, 
            all the apps you access from <span style="color:red">OneLogin</span>- everything that we manage to reach - are completely locked. 
            Moreover, we have taken a great amount of your corporate data prior to encryption.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Well, for now let's keep all the tears and resentment to ourselves and try to build a constructive dialogue. 
            We're fully aware of what damage we are causing by locking your internal sources. At the moment, you have to know:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Paying us you save your TIME, MONEY, EFFORTS and be back on track within 24 hours approximately. 
                <span style="color:red">Our decryptor </span>works properly on any files or systems, so you will be able to check it by requesting a test decryption service from the beginning 
                of our conversation. If you decide to recover on your own, keep in mind that you can permanently lose access to some files or accidently corrupt them 
                - in this case we won't be able to help.
            </li>
            <li>
                As for your data, if we fail to agree, we will try to sell personal information/trade secrets/databases/source codes 
                - generally speaking, everything that has a value on the darkmarket - to multiple threat actors at ones. 
                Then all of this will be published in our blog.
            </li>
            <li>
                We're more than negotiable and will definitely find the way to settle this quickly and reach an agreement which will satisfy both of us.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If you're indeed interested in our assistance and the services we provide you can reach out to us (we have your email, we will be in contact).
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind that the faster you will get in touch, the less damage we cause.
